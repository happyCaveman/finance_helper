Notes: Data are for calendar years with these exceptions: 1965 and 1966, year ended 9/30; 1967, 15 months ended 12/31. 
Starting in 1979, accounting rules required insurance companie s to value the equity securities they hold at market
rather than at the lower of cost or market, which was prev iously the requirement. In this table, Berkshire’s results
through 1978 have been restated to conform to the changed rule s. In all other respects, the results are calculated using
the numbers originally reported. 
The S&P 500 numbers are pre-tax whereas the Berkshire numbers are after-tax. If a corporation such as Berkshire
were simply to have owned the S&P 500 and accrued the appr opriate taxes, its results would have lagged the S&P 500
in years when that index showed a positive return, but would have exceeded the S&P in years when the index showed a
negative return. Over the years, the tax costs would have caused the aggregate lag to be substantial. 

Our gain in net worth during 2004 was $8.3 billion, which increased the per-share book value of
both our Class A a nd Class B stock by 10.5%. Over the last 40 y ears (that is, since present management
took over) book value has grown from $19 to $55,824, a rate of 21.9% compounded annually.* 

It’s pe r-share intrinsic val ue t hat cou nts, however, n ot bo ok val ue. Here, t he ne ws i s go od:
Between 196 4 an d 200 4, Berk shire morphed fro m a st ruggling north ern tex tile b usiness whose in trinsic
value was less th an book in to a d iversified en terprise w orth fa r m ore than book. Our 40-year gain in
intrinsic value has therefore somewhat exceeded our 21.9% gain in book. (For an e xplanation of intrinsic
value and the economic principles that guide Charlie Munger, my partner and B erkshire’s vice-chairman,
and me in running Berkshire, please read our Owner’s Manual, beginning on page 73.)

Despite their shortcomings, yearly calculations of book value are useful at Berkshire as a sligh tly
understated gauge for measuring the long-term rate of increase in our intrinsic value. The calculations are
less relevant, however, than they once were in rating any single year’s performance versus the S&P 500
index (a comparison we display on the facing page). Our equity holdings (including convertible preferreds)
have fallen con siderably as a p ercentage of o ur n et wo rth, fr om an av erage of 114% in th e 1 980s, f or
example, to less than 50% in recent years. Therefore, yearly movements in the stoc k market now affe ct a
much s maller p ortion of ou r n et worth th an was once t he case, a fact th at will n ormally cau se us to
underperform in years when stocks rise substantially and overperform in years when they fall. 

However the yearly co mparisons work out, Berk shire’s long-term perform ance vers us the S&P
remains all-important. Our shareholders can buy the S&P through an index fund at very low cost. Unless
we achieve gains in per-share intrinsic value in the future that outdo the S&P, Charlie and I will be adding
nothing to what you can accomplish on your own. 

Last year , Berk shire’s boo k-value gain of 10.5% f ell sho rt of t he index ’s 10 .9% return. Our
lackluster performance was n ot due to any stumbles by the CEOs of our operating businesses: As always,
they pulled more than their share of the load. My m essage to them is simple: Run your business as if it
were the only asset your family will own over the next hundred years. Almost invariably they do just that
and, after taking care of the needs of their business, send excess cash to Omaha for me to deploy. 

I didn’t do that job very well last year. My hope wa s to make several multi-billion dollar
acquisitions that wou ld add new and significant streams of earnings to the many we alread y have. But I
struck out. Additionally, I found very few attractive securities to buy. Berkshire therefore ended the year
with $43 billion of cash equivalents, not a happy position. Charlie and I will work to translate some of this
hoard into more interesting assets during 2005, though we can’t promise success. 

In one res pect, 2004 was a rem arkable year fo r the stoc k m arket, a fact burie d in the maze of
numbers on page 2. If yo u examine the 35 years sin ce the 1960s ended, you will find th at an investor’s
return, i ncluding dividends, from owni ng t he S&P has a veraged 11.2% annua lly (well above what we
expect future returns to be). But if yo u look for years with returns any where close to that 11.2% – say,
between 8% and 14% – you will find only one before 2004. In other words, last year’s “normal” return is
anything but. 

 * All figures used in this report apply to Berkshire’s A shares, the successor to the only stock that 
the company had outstanding before 1996. The B shares have an economic interest equal to 1/30th that of
the A.

Over the 35 years, American business has delivered terrific results. It should therefore have been
easy fo r inv estors to earn juicy retu rns: All th ey h ad to d o was piggyback Corporate Am erica in a
diversified, low-expense way. An i ndex fund that they never touched would have done the job. In stead
many investors have had experiences ranging from mediocre to disastrous. 

There ha ve been three primary causes: first, high c osts, usually because inves tors t raded
excessively or spent far too much on investment management; second, portfolio decisions based on tips and
fads rather than on thoughtful, quantified evaluation of businesses; and third, a star t-and-stop approach to
the market marked by untimely entries (after an advance has been long underway) and exits (after periods
of stagnation or decline). Investors should remember that excitement and expenses are their enemies. And
if they insist on trying to time th eir participation in equities, they should try to be fearful when others are
greedy and greedy only when others are fearful. 

Sector Results

As managers, Charlie and I want to give our owners the financial information and commentary we
would wish t o receive if our roles were re versed. To do this with both clar ity and reasonable bre vity
becomes more di fficult as B erkshire’s sc ope widens. Some of o ur businesses have vast ly di fferent
economic characteristics from others, which means that our consolidated statements, with their jumble of
figures, make useful analysis almost impossible. 

On the following pages, therefore, we will present some balance sheet and earnings figures from
our four major categories of businesses along with commentary about each. We particularly want you to
understand the li mited circumstances under which we will use debt, given that we typically shun it. We
will not, however, inundate you with data that has no real value in estimating Berkshire’s intrinsic value. 
Doing so would tend to obfuscate the facts that count. 

[SECTION: Regulated Utility Businesses]

We have an 80.5% (fully diluted) interest in MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which owns a wide
variety of utility operations. The largest of these are (1) Yorkshire Electricity and Northern Electric, whose
3.7 m illion electric cu stomers m ake it t he th ird larg est d istributor of electricity in th e U.K.; (2) 
MidAmerican Energy, which serves 698,000 electric customers, primarily in Iowa; and (3) Kern River and
Northern Natural pipelines, which carry 7.9% of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. 

The remaining 19.5% of MidAmerican is owned by three partners of ours: Dave Sokol and Greg
Abel, th e brilliant managers o f th ese bu sinesses, an d Walter Sco tt, a lo ng-time frien d of m ine who
introduced me to the company. Becau se MidAmerican is sub ject to the Pub lic Utility Ho lding Company
Act (“PUHCA”), Berkshire’s voting interest is limited to 9.9%. Voting control rests with Walter. 

 Our limited v oting i nterest forces us to acco unt for Mi dAmerican in an ab breviated m anner. 
Instead of our fully incorporating the company’s assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into Berkshire’s
statements, we m ake o ne-line en tries only in both our balance sheet and in come a ccount. It’s lik ely,
though, t hat PUHC A will someday – perhaps soon – be repeale d or that accoun ting rules will cha nge. 
Berkshire’s consolidated figures would then incorporate all of MidAmerican, including the substantial debt
it utilizes (though this debt is not now, nor will it ever be, an obligation of Berkshire). 

At yearend, $1.478 billion of MidAmerican’s junior debt was payable to Berkshire. This debt has
allowed ac quisitions t o be f inanced without o ur partners nee ding t o i ncrease their already s ubstantial
investments in MidAmerican. By charging 11% interest, Berkshire is compensated fairly for putting up the
funds needed for purchases, wh ile ou r p artners are sp ared dilution of th eir equ ity in terests. Becau se
MidAmerican made no large acquisitions last year, it paid down $100 million of what it owes us. 

4
MidAmerican also owns a significant non-utility business, HomeServices of America, the second
largest real estate broker in the country. Unlike our utility operations, this business is highly cyclical, but
nevertheless on e we view en thusiastically. We h ave an exceptional manager, Ron Peltier, wh o th rough
both his acquisition and operational skills is building a brokerage powerhouse. 

HomeServices participated in $59.8 billion of transactions in 2004, a gain of $11.2 billion from
2003. About 24% o f t he i ncrease cam e fr om si x acqui sitions m ade d uring t he y ear. Th rough our 17 
brokerage firms – all o f which retain their local identities – we em ploy more than 18,000 brokers in 1 8
states. HomeServices is almost certain to grow substantially in the ne xt decade as we continue to acquire
leading localized operations. 

Last year MidAmerican wrote off a major investment in a zinc recovery project that was initiated
in 1998 and became operational in 2002. Large quantities of zinc are present in the brine produced by our
California ge othermal operat ions, an d we believed we c ould p rofitably ext ract t he metal. For m any
months, it appeared that commercially- viable recov eries were i mminent. Bu t in mining, ju st as in o il
exploration, prospects have a way of “teasing” their developers, and every time one problem was s olved,
another popped up. In September, we threw in the towel. 

Our failure here illustrates the importance of a guideline – stay with simple propositions – that we
usually ap ply in inv estments as well as operations. If only on e variable is k ey t o a d ecision, an d th e
variable has a 90% chance of going your way, the chance for a successful outcome is obviously 90%. But
if ten independent variables need to break favorably for a successful result, and each has a 90% probability
of s uccess, the likelihood of having a winner is only 35 %. In our zinc vent ure, we solved most of the
problems. But one proved intractable, and t hat was one too many. Si nce a chai n is no stronger than its
weakest link, it makes sense to look for – if you’ll excuse an oxymoron – mono-linked chains. 

A breakdown of MidAmerican’s results follows. In 2004, the “other” category includes a $7 2.2
million profit from sale of an Enro n receivable that was thrown in wh en we purc hased Northern Na tural
two years earlier. Walter, Dave and I, as natives of Omaha, view this unanticipated gain as war reparations
– partial compensation for the lo ss our city su ffered in 1986 when Ken Lay moved Northern to Houston,
after promising to leave the company here. (For details, see Berkshire’s 2002 annual report.)

Insurance

Since Berkshire purchased National Indemnity (“NICO”) in 1967, property-casualty insurance has
been our core business and the propellant of our growth. Insurance has provided a fountain of funds with
which we’ve acquired the securities and businesses that now give us an ever-widening variety of earnings
streams. So in this section, I will be spending a little time telling you how we got where we are. 

The source of our insurance funds is “float,” which is money that doesn’t belong to us but that we
temporarily hold. Most of our fl oat arises because (1) pre miums are pa id upfront though the servic e we
provide – insurance protection – i s delivered over a pe riod that usually covers a y ear and; (2) loss events
that occur today do not always resu lt in our immediately paying claims, because it sometim es takes many
years for lo sses to b e repo rted (asb estos lo sses wou ld b e an ex ample), negotiated and settled . Th e $20
million of float that came with our 1967 purchase has now increased – both by way of internal growth and
acquisitions – to $46.1 billion. 

Float i s w onderful – if it d oesn’t co me at a h igh price. Its co st is d etermined b y un derwriting
results, meaning how the expenses and losses we will ultimately pay compare with the premiums we have
received. When an underwriting profit is achieve d – as has been the case at Berkshire in about half of the
38 years we have been in the insurance business – float is better than free. In such years, we are actually 
paid for holding other people’s money. For m ost insurers, however, life has been far more difficult: In
aggregate, the property-casualty i ndustry al most invariabl y ope rates at an underwriting loss . When that
loss is large, float becomes expensive, sometimes devastatingly so. 

Insurers have generally ear ned poor ret urns f or a si mple reas on: They sel l a com modity-like
product. P olicy forms are st andard, and the product is available from many suppliers, some of whom are
mutual companies (“owned” by policyholders rather than stockholders) with profit g oals that are li mited. 
Moreover, most insureds don’t care f rom whom they buy. C ustomers by the millions say “I need some
Gillette blades” or “I’ll have a Coke” but we wait in vain for “I’d like a National Indemnity policy, please.”
Consequently, price competition in insurance is usually fierce. Think airline seats. 

So, you may ask, how do Berkshire’s insurance operations overcome the dismal economics of the
industry and achieve some measure of enduring competitive advantage? We’ve attacked that problem in
several ways. Let’s look first at NICO’s strategy. 

When we purchased the company – a specialist in commercial auto and general liability insurance
– it did not appear to have any attributes that would overcome the industry’s chronic troubles. It was not
well-known, had no informational advantage (the company has never had an actuary), was not a l ow-cost
operator, and sold through general age nts, a method m any people thou ght outdate d. Neve rtheless, for
almost all of the past 38 years, NICO has been a star performer. Indeed, had we not made this acquisition,
Berkshire would be lucky to be worth half of what it is today. 

What we ’ve h ad going f or us i s a m anagerial m indset that m ost i nsurers fi nd i mpossible t o
replicate. Tak e a l ook at the facing page. Can you imagine any public company e mbracing a busi ness
model t hat woul d l ead t o t he decl ine i n r evenue t hat w e expe rienced from 198 6 t hrough 1999? That
colossal slide, it should be emphasized, did not occur because business was unobtainable. Many billions of
premium dollars were readily available to NICO had we only been willing to cut prices. B ut we i nstead
consistently priced to make a profit, not to match our most optimistic competitor. We never left customers
– but they left us. 

Most American businesses harbor an “institutional imperative” that rejects extended decreases in
volume. What CEO wants to report to his shareholders that not only did business contract last year but that
it will continue to drop ? In insu rance, the urge to keep writing busi ness is also intensified because the
consequences of foolishly-priced p olicies m ay not bec ome appare nt f or s ome t ime. If a n i nsurer i s
optimistic in its reserving, reported earnings will b e overstated, and years m ay pass before true loss costs
are revealed (a form of self-deception that nearly destroyed GEICO in the early 1970s).

*It takes a long time to learn the tr ue profitability of any given year. First, many claims are received after 
the end of t he year, and we must estimate how many of these there will b e and what they will co st. (In
insurance jargon, these claim s are te rmed IBNR – i ncurred but not reported.) Sec ond, claims often take
years, or even decades, to settle, which means there can be many surprises along the way. 

For these reasons, the results in this column simply represent our best estimate at the end of 2004 as to how
we have don e in prior year s. Pro fit m argins for t he year s thro ugh 1999 ar e pr obably clo se to corr ect
because these years are “mature,” in the sense that they have few claims still outstanding. The more recent
the year, th e more guesswork is invo lved. In particular, the results shown for 200 3 and 2004 are apt to
change significantly. 

7
Finally, there is a fear factor at work, in that a shri nking business usually leads to layoffs. To
avoid pink slips, em ployees will ration alize in adequate pricin g, tellin g th emselves th at poorly-priced
business must be tolerated in order to keep the organization intact and the distribution system happy. If this
course isn’t follo wed, th ese e mployees will arg ue, th e company will n ot p articipate in th e recovery th at
they invariably feel is just around the corner. 

To com bat em ployees’ nat ural t endency t o save t heir ow n ski ns, we ha ve al ways prom ised
NICO’s workforce that no one will be fired because of declining volume, however severe the contraction. 
(This is not Donald Trump’s sort of place.) NICO is not labor-intensive, and, as the table suggests, can live
with excess overhead. It can’t live, however, with underpriced business and the breakdown in underwriting
discipline that accompanies it. An insurance organization that doesn’t care deeply about underwriting at a
profit this year is unlikely to care next year either. 

Naturally, a business th at fo llows a n o-layoff policy m ust be especia lly careful to avoid
overstaffing when times are good. Thirty years ago Tom Murphy, then CEO of Cap Cities, drove this point
home t o m e with a hypothetical t ale about an em ployee w ho a sked his b oss for permission t o h ire an
assistant. The employee assumed that adding $20,000 to the annual payroll would be inconsequential. But
his boss told him the proposal should be evaluated as a $3 million decision, given that an additional person
would probably cost at least that amount over his lifetime, factoring in raises, benefits and other expenses
(more people, more toilet paper). And unless the company fell on very hard times, the employee added
would be unlikely to be dismissed, however marginal his contribution to the business. 

 It takes real fortitude – embedded deep within a c ompany’s culture – to operate as NICO does. 
Anyone examining the table can scan the years from 1986 to 1999 quickly. But living day after day with
dwindling volume – while competitors are b oasting of growth and reaping Wall Street’s applause – is an
experience few managers can tolerate. NICO, however, has had four CEOs since its formation in 1940 and
none have bent. (It should be noted that only one of the four graduated from college. Our experience tells

us that extraordinary business ability is largely innate.)

The cu rrent m anagerial st ar – m ake t hat supe rstar – at NIC O is Do n Wu rster (y es, he’s “the
graduate”), who has been running things since 1989. His slugging percentage is right up there with Barry
Bonds’ because, like Barry, Don will accept a walk rather than swing at a bad pitch. Don has now amassed
$950 million of float at NICO that over time is almost certain to be proved the negative-cost kind. Because
insurance prices are falling, Don’s volume will soon decline very significantly and, as it does, Charlie and I
will applaud him ever more loudly. 

* * * * * * * * * * * * 
Another way to prosper in a commodity-type business is to be the low-cost operator. Among auto
insurers operating on a broad scale, GEICO holds that cherished title. For NICO, as we have seen, an ebb-
and-flow b usiness m odel m akes se nse. But a c ompany hol ding a l ow-cost a dvantage m ust p ursue a n
unrelenting foot-to-the-floor strategy. And that’s just what we do at GEICO. 

A century ago, when autos first appeared, the property-casualty industry operated as a cartel. The
major companies, most of wh ich were base d in the Northeast, established “bureau” rates and t hat was it. 
No one cut prices to attract business. Instead, insurers competed for strong, well-regarded agents, a focus
that produced high commissions for agents and high prices for consumers. 

In 1922, State Farm was formed by George Mecherle, a farmer from Merna, Illinois, who aimed to
take adva ntage of t he pri cing um brella maintained by t he hi gh-cost gi ants of t he i ndustry. St ate Farm
employed a “captive” agency force, a system keeping its acquisition costs lower than those incurred by the
bureau insurers (whose “independent” agents successfully played off on e company against another). With
its low-c ost s tructure, State Farm event ually captured about 25% of t he personal lines (a uto and
homeowners) busi ness, far o utdistancing i ts once -mighty com petitors. Al lstate, for med i n 19 31, put a
similar distribution system into place a nd soon became the runner-up in personal lines t o State Farm . 
Capitalism had worked its magic, and these low-cost operations looked unstoppable.

But a man named Leo G oodwin had an i dea for an even more efficient auto ins urer and, with a
skimpy $200,000, started GEICO in 1936. Goodwin’s plan was to eliminate the agent entirely and to deal
instead di rectly with the auto ow ner. Why, he as ked him self, shoul d there be any unnecessary and
expensive links in the distribution mechanism when t he product, auto insurance, was both mandatory and
costly. Purc hasers o f business i nsurance, he reas oned, might wel l req uire p rofessional advi ce, b ut most
consumers knew what they needed in an auto policy. That was a powerful insight. 

 Originally, GEICO m ailed its low-cost message to a l imited audience of government employees. 
Later, it widened its horizons and shifted its marketing emphasis to the phone, working inquiries that came
from broadcast and print advertising. And today the Internet is coming on strong. 

Between 1936 and 1975, GEICO grew from a standing start to a 4% m arket share, becoming the
country’s fo urth larg est au to insurer. Duri ng m ost o f th is p eriod, th e co mpany was su perbly managed,
achieving both excellent volume gains and high profits. I t looked unstoppable. B ut after my friend and
hero L orimer Davi dson retired as C EO i n 19 70, his suc cessors s oon made a h uge mistake by un der-
reserving for losses. This produced faulty cost information, which in turn produced inadequate pricing. By
1976, GEICO was on the brink of failure. 

Jack Byrne then joined GEICO as CEO and, almost single-handedly, saved the company by heroic
efforts that included major price incr eases. Though GEICO’s survi val required these, policyholders fled
the company, and by 1980 its market share had fallen to 1.8%. Subsequently, the company embarked on
some u nwise diversification m oves. This sh ift of emphasis away from its extraordinary c ore bus iness
stunted GEICO’s growth, and by 1993 its market share had grown only fractionally, to 1.9%. Then Tony
Nicely took charge. 

 And what a differen ce th at’s made: In 2005 GEICO will p robably secu re a 6% m arket sh are. 
Better yet, To ny h as m atched g rowth with p rofitability. In deed, GEICO d elivers all of its co nstituents
major benefits: In 2004 its customers saved $1 billion or so compared to what they would otherwise have
paid for coverage, its associates earned a $191 million profit-sharing bonus that averaged 24.3% of salary,
and its owner – that’s us – enjoyed excellent financial returns. 

There’s mo re g ood n ews. W hen J ack Byr ne was re scuing the com pany in 1976, New Je rsey
refused t o grant hi m the rat es he needed to operate p rofitably. He t herefore promptly – an d properly –
withdrew from the state. Subsequently, GEICO avoided both New Jersey and Massachusetts, recognizing
them as two jurisdictions in which insurers were destined to struggle. 

In 2003, however, New Jersey took a new look at its chronic auto-insurance problems and enacted
legislation that would curb fraud and allow insurers a fair playing field. Even so, one might have expected
the state’s bureaucracy to make change slow and difficult. 

But just the opposite occurred. Holly Bakke, the New Jersey insurance commissioner, who would
be a success i n any lin e of work, was determined to tu rn th e law’s in tent in to reality. With h er staff’s
cooperation, GEICO iro ned out th e d etails fo r re-entering the state and was license d last August. Since
then, we’ve received a response from New Jersey drivers that is multiples of my expectations. 

We are n ow serving 140,000 policyholders – abo ut 4% of the New Jersey market – and sa ving
them substantial sums (as we do drivers everywhere). Word-of-mouth recommendations within the state
are causing inquiries to pour in. A nd once we hea r from a New Jersey prospect, our closure rate – the
percentage of policies issued to inquiries received – is far higher in the state than it is nationally. 

We make no claim, of co urse, that we can save everyone money. Som e companies, using rating
systems that are different from o urs, will o ffer certain classes o f drivers a lower rate than we do. Bu t we
believe GEICO offers the lowest price more often than any other national company that serves all segments
of t he public. In a ddition, in m ost states, includi ng Ne w Jersey, Be rkshire share holders recei ve a n 8%
discount. So gam ble fifteen minutes of y our time and go to GEICO.com – or cal l 800-847-7536 – to see

whether y ou can save big money (whi ch y ou m ight want t o use , of cou rse, t o buy ot her B erkshire
products).

Reinsurance – insura nce sol d to othe r ins urers w ho wish t o l ay off p art of t he ri sks t hey have
assumed – should not be a commodity product. At bottom, any insurance policy is simply a promise, and
as everyone knows, promises vary enormously in their quality. 

At th e prim ary in surance lev el, n evertheless, just w ho makes t he p romise i s oft en of m inor
importance. In personal-lines insurance, for example, states levy assessments on solvent companies to pay
the po licyholders of co mpanies th at go broke. In the b usiness-insurance fi eld, the sam e arrangement
applies to workers’ compensation policies. “Protected” policies of these types account for about 60% of
the property-casualty industry’s volume. Prudently-run insurers are irritated by the need to subsidize poor
or reckless management elsewhere, but that’s the way it is. 

Other forms of business insurance at the primary level involve promises that carry greater risks for
the insured. When Reliance Insurance and Home Insurance were run into the ground, for e xample, their
promises proved to be worthless. C onsequently, many holders of their business policies (other than those
covering workers’ compensation) suffered painful losses. 

The solvency risk in primary policies, however, pales in comparison to that lurking in reinsurance
policies. When a reinsurer goes broke, staggering losses almost always strike the primary companies it has
dealt with. Th is risk is far from minor: GEICO has suffered tens of millio ns in losses from its care less
selection of reinsurers in the early 1980s. 

Were a tru e mega-catastrophe to occur in th e next decade or two – and that’s a real possibility –
some reinsurers would not survive. Th e largest insured loss to date is th e World Trade Center disaster,
which cost the insurance industry an estimated $35 billion. Hurricane Andrew cost insurers about $15.5
billion in 1992 (though that loss would be far higher in today’s dollars). Both events rocked the insurance
and reinsurance world. But a $100 billion event, or even a larger catastrophe, remains a possibility if either
a particularly severe ea rthquake or hurricane hits just the wrong place. Four significant hurricanes struck
Florida during 2004, causing an aggregate of $25 billion or so in insured losses. Two o f these – Charley
and Ivan – could have done at least three times the damage they did had they entered the U.S. not far from
their actual landing points. 

Many insurers regard a $100 billion industry loss as “unthinkable” and won’t even plan for it. But
at Berkshire, we are fully prepared. Our share of the loss would probably be 3% to 5%, and earnings from
our investments and other businesses would comfortably exceed that cost. When “the day after” arrives,
Berkshire’s checks will clear. 

Though th e hurricanes h it u s with a $1 .25 billion lo ss, ou r reinsurance o perations d id well last
year. At General Re, Joe Brandon has restored a long-admired culture of underwriting discipline that, for a
time, had lost its way. The excellent results he realized in 2004 on current business, however, were offset
by adverse developments from the years before he t ook the helm. At NICO’s reinsurance operation, Ajit
Jain continues to succes sfully underwrite huge risks that no other rei nsurer is willing or a ble to ac cept. 
Ajit’s value to Berkshire is enormous.

Berkshire’s float in creased $1 .9 b illion in 2 004, ev en tho ugh a few insu reds op ted to co mmute
(that is, unwind) certain reinsurance contracts. We agree to such commutations only when we believe the
economics are favorable to us (after giving due weight to what we might earn in the future on the money
we are returning). 

To summarize, last year we were p aid more than $1.5 billion to hold an av erage of about $45.2
billion. In 2005 pricing will b e less attractive than it has been. Nevertheless, absent a m ega-catastrophe,
we have a decent chance of achieving no-cost float again this year. 

[SECTION: Finance and Finance Products]

Last year in th is sectio n we d iscussed a potpourri of act ivities. In t his report, we’ll sk ip over
several that are now of lesser importance: B erkadia is down to tag ends; Value Capital h as added other
investors, ne gating o ur e xpectation t hat we wo uld nee d to co nsolidate its fin ancials in to ou rs; and th e
trading operation that I run continues to shrink. 

• Both of Berkshire’s leasing operations rebounded last year. At CORT (office furniture), earnings 
remain i nadequate, but are t rending upward. X TRA disposed o f i ts c ontainer a nd i ntermodal
businesses in order to co ncentrate on trailer leasin g, long its stro ng su it. Ov erhead h as b een
reduced, asset u tilization is u p and decent profits are now b eing achieved under Bill Franz, the
company’s new CEO. 

• The wind-down of Gen Re Securities continues. We decided to exit this derivative operation three 
years ago, but getting out is easier said than done. Though derivative instruments are purported to
be highly liquid – and though we have had the benefit of a benign market while liquidating ours –
we still h ad 2,890 con tracts outstanding at yearend , down fro m 2 3,218 at th e peak. Like Hell,
derivative trading is easy to enter but difficult to leave. (Other similarities come to mind as well.)

Gen Re’s derivative contracts have always been required to be marked to market, and I believe the
company’s m anagement co nscientiously t ried t o m ake rea listic “m arks.” The m arket pri ces of
derivatives, however, can be v ery fuzzy in a world i n wh ich settlemen t o f a tran saction is
sometimes decades away and o ften involves multiple variables as well. In the interim the marks
influence t he managerial an d t rading bonuses t hat are paid annually. It’s s mall wonde r that
phantom profits are often recorded. 

Investors should und erstand that in all types of fin ancial institutions, rap id grow th sometimes
masks major underlying problems (and occasionally fraud). The re al test of the earning power of
a derivatives operation is what it ach ieves after operating for an extended period in a no-growth
mode. You only learn who has been swimming naked when the tide goes out. 

• After 40 years, we’ve finally generated a little synergy at Berkshire: Clayton Homes is doing well 
and th at’s in part due to its asso ciation with B erkshire. T he m anufactured ho me in dustry
11
continues to reside in the intensive care unit of Corporate America, having sold less than 135,000
new ho mes la st year, abou t the same as in 20 03. Vo lume in th ese y ears was th e lo west since
1962, an d i t was al so only abo ut 40% of ann ual sales d uring th e year s 19 95-99. That era, 
characterized by irresponsible financing and naïve funders, was a fool’s paradise for the industry. 

Because one major le nder after anot her has fle d the field, fi nancing continues t o be devil
manufacturers, ret ailers an d purchasers of manufactured homes. He re Berkshire’s s upport has
proven valuable t o C layton. We st and r eady to fund whatever m akes sen se, an d last year
Clayton’s management found much that qualified. 

As we explained in our 2003 report, we believe in using borrowed money to support profitable,
interest-bearing receivables. At the beginning of last year, we had borrowed $2 billion to relend to
Clayton (at a one percentage-point markup) and by January 2005 the total was $7.35 billion. Most
of the dollars added were borrowed by us on January 4, 2005, to finance a seasoned portfolio that
Clayton purchased on December 30, 2004 from a bank exiting the business. 

We now have two additional portfolio purchases in the works, totaling about $1.6 billion, but it’s
quite unlikely that we will secure others of any significance. Therefore, Clayton’s receivables (in
which o riginations will roughly offset p ayoffs) will probab ly ho ver arou nd $9 billion for so me
time and should deliver steady earnings. This pattern will be far different from that of the past, in
which Clayton, like all major players in its industry, “securitized” its receivables, causing earnings
to be front-ended. In the last two years, the securitization market has dried up. The limited funds
available t oday com e onl y at hi gher c ost an d with harsh t erms. Ha d C layton rem ained
independent in this period, it would have had mediocre earnings as it struggled with financing. 

In April, Clayton completed the acquisition of Oakwood Homes and is now th e industry’s largest
producer and retailer of manufactured homes. We love putting more assets in the hands of Kevin
Clayton, the company’s CEO. He is a prototype Berkshire manager. Today, Clayton has 11,837
employees, up from 7,136 when we purchased it, and Charlie and I are pleased that Berkshire has
been useful in facilitating this growth. 

For simplicity’s sake, we include all of Clayton’s earnings in this sector, t hough a sizable portion
of these are derived from areas other than consumer finance.

This eclectic group, which sells products ranging from Dilly Bars to fractional interests in Boeing
737s, earned a very respectable 21.7% on average tangible net worth last year, compared to 20.7% in 2003. 
It’s noteworthy that these operations used only minor financial leverage in achieving these returns. Clearly,
we own some very good businesses. We purchased many of them, however, at substantial premiums to net
worth – a m atter that is reflected in th e goodwill item shown on the balance sheet – and that fact reduces
the earnings on our average carrying value to 9.9%.

* From date of acquisition, May 23, 2003. 

• In the building-products sector and at Shaw, we’ve experienced staggering cost increases for both raw-
materials and energy. By Dece mber, for e xample, steel costs at MiTek (whose prim ary business is
connectors for ro of tru sses) were ru nning 100% ov er a year ear lier. And MiTek uses 665 m illion
pounds o f st eel every y ear. Ne vertheless, t he c ompany co ntinues t o be a n outstanding performer. 
13
Since we purchased MiTek in 2 001, Gene To ombs, its CEO, h as m ade so me b rilliant “bo lt-on”
acquisitions and is on his way to creating a mini-Berkshire. 

Shaw fielded a barrage of price increases in its main fiber materials during the year, a hit that added
more th an $300 m illion to its co sts. (Wh en you walk on ca rpet y ou a re, i n e ffect, stepping on
processed oil.) Though we followed these hikes in costs with price increases of our own, there was an
inevitable lag. Therefore, margins narrowed as the year progressed and remain under pressure today. 
Despite these roadblocks, Shaw, led by Bob Shaw and Julian Saul, earned an o utstanding 25.6% on
tangible equity in 2004. The company is a powerhouse and has a bright future. 

• In app arel, Fru it of th e Loom increased un it sales b y 10 m illion do zen, or 14 %, with sh ipments of 
intimate apparel for women and girls growing by 31%. Charlie, who is far more knowledgeable than I
am on this subject, assures me that women are not wearing more underwear. With this expert input, I
can only conclude that our market share in the women’s category must be growing rapidly. Thanks to
John Holland, Fruit is on the move. 

A sm aller ope ration, Garan, al so ha d a n excellent y ear. Le d by Seymour Li chtenstein an d Jerry
Kamiel, this company manufactures the popular Garanimals line for children. Next time you are in a
Wal-Mart, check out this imaginative product. 

• Among our re tailers, Ben Bridge (jewelry) a nd R. C . Willey (hom e furnishi ngs) were pa rticular 
standouts last year. 

At Ben Bridge same-store sal es grew 11.4%, the best gain among the publicly-held jewelers whose
reports I have seen. Additionally, the company’s profit marg in widened. Last year was not a fl uke:
During the past decade, the same-store sales gains of the company have averaged 8.8%. 

Ed and Jon Bridge are fourth-generation managers and run the business exactly as if it were their own
– which it is in every res pect except for Berkshire’s name on the stock certificates. The Bridges have
expanded successfully by securing the right locations and, more importantly, by staffing these stores
with enthusiastic and knowledgeable associates. We will move into Minneapolis-St. Paul this year. 

At Utah-based R. C. Willey, the gains from expansion have been even more dramatic, with 41.9% of
2004 sales coming from out-of-state stores that didn’t exist before 1999. The company also improved 
its profit margin in 2004, propelled by its two new stores in Las Vegas. 

I would like to tell you that these stores were my idea. In truth, I thought they were mistakes. I knew,
of course, how brilliantly Bill Child had run the R. C. Willey operation in Utah, where its market share
had long been huge. But I felt our closed-on-Sunday policy would prove disastrous away from home. 
Even our first out-of-state store in Boise, which was highly successful, left me unconvinced. I kept
asking w hether Las Ve gas r esidents, c onditioned t o seve n-day-a-week retailers, w ould ad just t o us. 
Our fi rst Las Vegas store, ope ned i n 2001, a nswered t his q uestion i n a re sounding m anner,
immediately becoming our number one unit. 

Bill and Sc ott Hymas, his successor as CEO, t hen proposed a sec ond Las Vegas store, only about 20
minutes away. I fel t this expansion would cannibalize the first unit, adding significant costs but only
modest sales. The result? Each store is now doing about 26% more volume than any other store in the
chain and is consistently showing large year-over-year gains. 

R. C. Willey will soon open in Reno. Before making this commitment, Bill and Scott again asked for
my advice. Initially, I was pretty puffed up about the fact that they were consulting me. B ut then it
dawned on me that the opinion of someone who is always wrong has its own special utility to decision-
makers.

• Earnings improved in flight services. At FlightSafety, the world’s leader in pilot training, profits rose 
as corporate aviation rebounded and our business with regional airlines increased. We now operate
283 simulators with an original cost of $1.2 billion. Pilots are trained one at a time on this expensive 
equipment. This means that as much as $3.50 of capital investment is required to produce $1 of annual
revenue. With this level of capital intensity, FlightSafety requires very high operating margins in order
to obtain reasonable returns on capital, which means that utilization rates are all-important. Last year,
FlightSafety’s return on tangible equity improved to 15.1% from 8.4% in 2003. 

In another 2004 event, Al Ueltschi, who founded FlightSafety in 1951 with $10,000, turned over the
CEO position to Bruce Whitman, a 43-year v eteran at the company. (But Al’s not going anywhere; I
won’t let him.) Bruce shares Al’s conviction that flying an aircraft is a privilege to be extended only to
people who re gularly receive the highest quality of traini ng a nd are undeniably com petent. A few
years ago, Charlie was asked to intervene with Al on behalf of a tycoon friend whom FlightSafety had
flunked. Al’s reply to Charlie: “Tell your pal he belongs in the back of the plane, not the cockpit.”

FlightSafety’s number one customer is NetJets, our aircraft fractional-ownership subsidiary. Its 2,100
pilots spend an average of 18 days a year i n training. Additionally, these pilots fly only one aircraft
type whe reas many fl ight o perations juggle pi lots among seve ral t ypes. Net Jets’ high st andards o n
both fronts are two of the reasons I signed up with the company years before Berkshire bought it. 

Fully as im portant i n m y d ecisions t o both use a nd buy Net Jets, ho wever, was t he fact t hat t he
company was managed by Rich Santulli, the creator of the fractional-ownership industry and a fanatic
about safety and service. I viewed the selection of a flight provider as akin to picking a brain surgeon:
you simply want the best. (Let someone else experiment with the low bidder.)

Last year NetJets again gained about 70% of the net new business (measured by dollar value) going to
the four c ompanies that dominate the industry. A portion of our growth came from the 25-hour card
offered by M arquis Jet Pa rtners. M arquis is not owned by Net Jets, but i s i nstead a customer t hat
repackages the purchases it makes from us into smaller packages that it sells through its card. Marquis
deals exclusively with NetJets, utilizing the power of our reputation in its marketing. 

Our U. S. co ntracts, i ncluding M arquis cust omers, gre w fr om 3,87 7 t o 4,9 67 i n 20 04 ( versus
approximately 1,200 contracts when Berkshire bought NetJets in 1998). Some clients (including me)
enter into multiple contracts because they wish to use more tha n one type of aircraft, selecting for any
given trip whichever type best fits the mission at hand. 

NetJets earned a m odest amount in the U.S. last year. B ut what we earned domestically was l argely
offset by l osses i n E urope. We are n ow, however, ge nerating real m omentum abroa d. C ontracts
(including 25-hour cards that we ourselves market in Europe) increased from 364 to 693 during the
year. We will ag ain have a very significant European loss in 2005, but domestic earnings will likely
put us in the black overall. 

Europe has been expensive for NetJets – fa r more expensive than I ant icipated – but it is essential to
building a fligh t operation that will fo rever be in a class by itself. Our U.S. owners already want a
quality serv ice wh erever they trav el an d th eir wish fo r fligh t ho urs ab road is certain to g row
dramatically in the decades ahead. Last year, U.S. owners made 2,003 flights in Europe, up 22% from
the previous year and 137% from 2000. Just as important, our European owners made 1,067 flights in
the U.S., up 65% from 2003 and 239% from 2000.

and i nstead vi ew o ur h oldings as fract ional owne rships i n b usinesses. Thi s i s an impo rtant di stinction. 
Indeed, this thinking has been the cornerstone of m y investment behavior since I was 19. At that time I
read Be n Gra ham’s The In telligent Investor, and the scale s fell from my ey es. (P reviously, I had been
entranced by the stock market, but didn’t have a clue about how to invest.)

Let’s look at how the businesses of our “Big Four” – American Express, Coca-Cola, Gillette and
Wells Fargo – have fared since we bo ught into these companies. As the tab le shows, we in vested $3.83
billion in the four, by way of multiple transactions between May 1988 and October 2003. On a composite
basis, o ur d ollar-weighted p urchase dat e i s Jul y 19 92. B y y earend 2 004, t herefore, we had held these
“business interests,” on a weighted basis, about 12½ years. 

In 2004, Berkshire’s share of the group’s earnings amounted to $1.2 billion. These earnings might
legitimately be considered “normal.” True, they were swelled because Gillette and Wells Fargo omitted
option costs in their presentation of earnings; but on the other hand they were reduced because Coke had a
non-recurring write-off. 

Our share of the earnings of these four companies has grown almost every year, and now amounts
to abo ut 31.3% o f our co st. Th eir cash distr ibutions to us h ave also gr own con sistently, to taling $434
million in 2004, or about 11.3% of cost. All in all, the Big Four have delivered us a satisfactory, though far
from spectacular, business result. 

That’s true as well of our experience in the market with the group. Since o ur original purchases,
valuation gains have somewhat exceeded earnings growth because price/earnings ratios have increased. On
a year-to-year basis, however, the business and market performances have often diverged, sometimes to an
extraordinary degree. During The Great Bubble, market-value gains far outstripped the performance of the
businesses. In the aftermath of the Bubble, the reverse was true. 
16
 Clearly, Berkshire’s results would have been far better if I had caught this swing of the pendulum. 
That m ay see m easy to d o when on e look s th rough an always-clean, rear-view mirror. Unfort unately,
however, it’s the windshield through which investors must peer, a nd that glass is invariably fogged. Our
huge positions add to the difficulty of our nimbly dancing in and out of holdings as valuations swing. 

Nevertheless, I can properly be criticized for merely clucking about nose-bleed valuations during
the Bubble rather than acting on m y views. Though I said at the tim e that certain of the stocks we held
were priced ahead of themselves, I underestimated just how severe the overvaluation was. I talk ed when I
should have walked. 

What Charlie and I would like is a little action now. We don’t enjoy sitting on $43 billion of cash
equivalents that are earni ng paltry returns. Instead, we yearn to buy more fractional interests similar to
those we now own or – better still – more large businesses outright. We will do either, however, only when
purchases can be made at prices that offer us the prospect of a reasonable return on our investment. 

* * * * * * * * * * * * 
We’ve re peatedly e mphasized that the “rea lized” gains that we re port quarterly or ann ually ar e
meaningless for analytical purposes. We have a huge amount of unrealized gains on our books, and our
thinking about when, and if, to cash them depends not at all on a desire to report earnings at one specific
time or anot her. A f urther complication in our reported gains occurs because GAAP requires that foreign
exchange contracts be m arked to m arket, a stipula tion th at cau ses unrealized g ains or lo sses in th ese
holdings to flow through our published earnings as if we had sold our positions. 

Despite the problems enumerated, you may be interested in a breakdown of the gains we reported
in 2 003 and 2004. Th e data r eflect actual sales exce pt in the cas e of cu rrency gai ns, w hich are a
combination of sales and marks to market.

Foreign Exchange Contracts........... 1,839 825

Total ............................................... $3,496 $4,129 

The junk bond profits include a foreign exchange component. When we bought these bonds in
2001 and 2002, we focused first, of course, on the credit quality of the issuers, all of which were American 
corporations. Some of t hese com panies, however, had i ssued bonds denominated i n f oreign cu rrencies. 
Because of our views on the dollar, we favored these for purchase when they were available. 

As an e xample, we b ought €254 million of Level 3 b onds (10 ¾% of 2008) in 2001 at 51.7% of
par, and sold these at 85% of par in December 2004. This issue was traded in Euros that cost us 88¢ at the
time of purchase but that brought $1.29 when we sold. Thus, of our $163 million overall gain, about $85
million cam e fro m th e m arket’s rev ised opinion ab out Lev el 3’s cred it quality, with t he rem aining $78
million resulting from the a ppreciation of the Euro. (In addition, we received cash interest during our
holding period that amounted to about 25% annually on our dollar cost.)

Even then, it is typically not I who make the buying decisions. Lou Simpson manages about $2½
billion of eq uities that are held b y GEICO, and it is h is tran sactions that Berk shire is u sually reporting. 
Customarily his pu rchases are in the $200-$300 million range and are i n companies that are sm aller than
the ones I foc us on. Ta ke a look at the fa cing page to see wh y Lo u is a cin ch to be in ducted in to th e

 You may be sur prised to learn that Lou does not necessarily inform me about what he is doing. 
When Charlie and I assign responsibility, we truly hand over the baton – and we give it to Lou just as we
do to our operating managers. Th erefore, I typically learn of Lou’s transactions about ten days after the
end of each month. Sometimes, it should be added, I silently disagree with his decisions. But he’s usually right. 

[SECTION: Foreign Currencies]

Berkshire owned about $21.4 billion of foreign exchange contracts at yearend, s pread among 12
currencies. A s I m entioned last year, holdings of this kind are a deci ded change for us. B efore March
2002, neither Berkshire nor I had ever traded in currencies. But the evidence grows that our trade policies 
will p ut un remitting p ressure on th e do llar for m any years to co me – so since 20 02 we’v e heeded th at
warning in setting our investment course. (As W.C. Fields once said when asked for a ha ndout: “Sorry,

son, all my money’s tied up in currency.”)

 Be clear on one point: In no way does our thinking about currencies rest on doubts about America. 
We live in an extraordinarily rich country, the product of a system that values market economics, the rule
of law a nd e quality of opportunity. Our economy is far and away th e strongest in the world a nd will
continue to be. We are lucky to live here. 

But as I argued in a November 10, 2003 article in Fortune, (available at berkshirehathaway.com),
our country’s trade practices are we ighing d own th e dollar. Th e d ecline in its v alue h as alread y been
substantial, but is n evertheless likely to continue. Without policy changes, currency markets could even
become disorderly and generate spillover effects, both political and financial. No one knows whether these
problems will materialize. But such a scenario is a far-from-remote possibility that policymakers should be
considering now. Their bent, however, is to lean toward not-so-benign neglect: A 318-page Congressional
study of t he co nsequences of un remitting trad e deficits was published in Nov ember 2 000 an d has b een
gathering dust ever since. The study was ordered after the deficit hit a then-alarming $263 billion in 1999;
by last year it had risen to $618 billion. 

Charlie and I, it should be emphasized, believe that true trade – that is, the exchange of goods and
services with other co untries – i s eno rmously benefi cial fo r b oth us an d t hem. Last year we ha d $ 1.15
trillion o f su ch ho nest-to-God trad e and th e m ore o f th is, th e b etter. Bu t, as n oted, o ur cou ntry also
purchased an ad ditional $6 18 billion in g oods and serv ices fro m the rest of the world th at was
unreciprocated. That is a staggering figure and one that has important consequences. 

The balancing item to this one-way pseudo-trade — in economics there is always an offset — is a
transfer of wealth from the U.S. to the rest of the world. The transfer may materialize in the form of IOUs
our private or governmental institutions give to foreigners, or by way o f their assuming ownership of o ur
assets, such as stocks and real estate. In e ither case, Americans end up owning a r educed portion of our
country while non-Americans own a greater part. This force-feeding of American wealth to the rest of the
world is now p roceeding at th e rate of $1 .8 billion daily, an increase of 2 0% since I wrote you last year. 
Consequently, other countries and their citizens now own a net of about $3 trillion of the U.S. A decade
ago their net ownership was negligible. 

The m ention of trillio ns nu mbs m ost b rains. A furth er so urce of con fusion is th at th e cu rrent
account deficit (the sum of three item s, the most important by far being the trade deficit) and our national
budget deficit are ofte n lum ped as “twins.” T hey are any thing b ut. They ha ve different cause s and
different consequences. 

19
A budget deficit in no way reduces the portion of the national pie that goes to Americans. As long
as other countries and their ci tizens have no net ow nership of the U.S ., 100% of o ur country’s o utput
belongs to our citizens under any budget scenario, even one involving a huge deficit. 

As a rich “famil y” awash in goo ds, Am ericans will argu e th rough their leg islators as to ho w
government should redistribute the national output – that is who pays taxes and who receives governmental
benefits. If “en titlement” p romises fro m an earlie r day have to b e reex amined, “fam ily members” will
angrily debate among themselves as to who feels the pain. Mayb e taxes will go up; maybe promises will
be modified; maybe more internal debt will b e issued. Bu t when the fight is fin ished, all of the fa mily’s
huge pie remains available for its members, however it is divided. No slice must be sent abroad. 

Large and persisting current account deficits produce an entirely different result. As time passes,
and as claims against us grow, we own less and less of what we produce. In eff ect, the rest of the world
enjoys an ev er-growing ro yalty o n Am erican ou tput. Here, we are lik e a fam ily th at co nsistently
overspends its income. As time p asses, the family finds that it is w orking more and more for the “finance
company” and less for itself. 

Should we con tinue to run current account deficits comparable to those now prevailing, the net
ownership of the U.S. by other countries and their citizens a decade fr om now will amount to roughly $11
trillion. And, if foreign investors were to earn only 5% on that net holding, we would need to send a net of
$.55 trillion of goods and services abroad every year merely to service the U.S. investments then held by
foreigners. At that date, a decade out, our GDP would probably total about $18 trillion (assuming low
inflation, which is far from a sure thing). Therefore, our U.S. “family” would then be delivering 3% of its
annual output to the rest o f the world simply as tri bute for the overi ndulgences of t he past. In t his case,
unlike that involving budget deficits, the sons would truly pay for the sins of their fathers. 

This an nual r oyalty pai d t he wo rld – which wo uld not di sappear unless t he U.S . massively
underconsumed an d began t o r un co nsistent an d l arge t rade s urpluses – would undoubtedly produce
significant political unrest in the U.S. Americans would still b e living very well, in deed better than now
because of the growth i n our economy. But they woul d chafe at the ide a of pe rpetually paying tribut e to
their creditors and owners abroad. A country that is now aspiring to an “Ownership Society” will not find
happiness in – and I’ll use hyperbole here for emphasis – a “Sharecropper’s Society.” But that’s precisely
where our trade policies, supported by Republicans and Democrats alike, are taking us. 

Many pr ominent U.S . fi nancial fi gures, b oth i n an d o ut of g overnment, ha ve st ated that o ur
current-account d eficits can not p ersist. For in stance, the minutes o f the Fed eral Reser ve Open Mar ket
Committee of June 29-30, 2004 say: “The staff noted that outsized external deficits could not be sustained
indefinitely.” But, despite the constant handwringing by luminaries, they offer no substantive suggestions
to tame the burgeoning imbalance. 

In the article I wrote for Fortune 16 months ago, I warned that “a gently declining dollar would
not provide the answer.” And so far it hasn’t. Yet policymakers continue to hope for a “s oft landing,”
meanwhile counseling other countries to stimulate (read “inflate”) their economies and Americans to save
more. I n my view these admonitions miss the mark: There are deep-rooted structural problems that will
cause Am erica to continue to run a huge current-account deficit unless trade poli cies either c hange
materially or the dollar declines by a degree that could prove unsettling to financial markets. 

Proponents o f t he t rade st atus qu o are f ond of q uoting A dam Sm ith: “What i s pr udence i n t he
conduct of every family can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom. If a foreign country can supply us
with a c ommodity cheape r t han we ourselves ca n m ake it, b etter bu y it o f th em with so me p art of the
produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage.”

I agree. Note, however, that Mr. Smith’s statement refers to tra de of product for product, not of
wealth for product as our country is doing to the tune of $.6 trillion annually. Moreover, I am sure that he
would never have suggested that “prudence” consisted of his “family” selling off part of its farm every day
20
in order to finance its overconsumption. Yet that is just what the “great kingdom” called the United States
is doing. 

If t he U.S. was ru nning a $.6 trillio n curren t-account surplus, commentators w orldwide wo uld
violently conde mn ou r policy, v iewing it as an ex treme form o f “m ercantilism” – a lo ng-discredited
economic strategy under which countries fostered exports, discouraged imports, and piled up treasure. I
would condemn such a policy as well. But, in effect if not in intent, the rest of th e world is practicing
mercantilism in respect to the U.S., an act made possible by our vast store of assets and our pristine credit
history. I ndeed, t he world would ne ver l et any ot her c ountry use a c redit car d denominated i n i ts o wn
currency to t he insatiable extent we are e mploying ours. Prese ntly, most foreign investors are sanguine:
they may view us as spending junkies, but they know we are rich junkies as well. 

Our spendthrift behavior won’t, however, be tolerated indefinitely. And though it’s impossible to
forecast just when a nd how t he tr ade problem will be resolve d, it’s improbable that the resoluti on will
foster an increase in the value of our currency relative to that of our trading partners. 

We hope the U.S. adopts policies th at will quickly and substantially reduce the current-account
deficit. Tru e, a p rompt so lution would lik ely cau se Berk shire to record lo sses on its foreign-exchange
contracts. But Berkshire’s resources remain heavily concentrated in dollar-based assets, and both a strong
dollar and a low-inflation environment are very much in our interest. 

If y ou wis h t o keep abreas t of trade and curre ncy m atters, read The Fi nancial Ti mes. This
London-based paper has long been the leading source for daily international financial news and now has an
excellent American edition. Both its reporting and commentary on trade are first-class. 

* * * * * * * * * * * * 
And, again, our usual caveat: macro-economics is a tough game in which few people, Charlie and
I in cluded, have d emonstrated sk ill. W e may well turn ou t to b e wrong in our currency judgm ents. 
(Indeed, the fact that so m any pundits now predict weakness for the dollar makes us uneasy.) If so, our
mistake will be very public. The i rony is that if we chos e the opposite course, leaving all of Berkshire’s
assets in dollars even as they declined significantly in value, no one would notice our mistake. 

John Maynard Keynes said in his masterful The General Theory: “Worldly wisdom teaches that it
is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally.” (Or, to put it in less elegant
terms, lemmings as a cl ass may be deri ded but never does an individual lemming get criticized.) Fro m a
reputational st andpoint, Ch arlie an d I run a clear risk wi th ou r foreign -exchange co mmitment. Bu t we
believe in managing Berkshire as if we owned 100% of it ourselves. And, were that the case, we would not
be following a dollar-only policy. 

Miscellaneous

• Last year I told you about a group of University of Tennessee finance students who played a key 
role in our $1.7 billion acquisition of Clayton Homes. Earlier, they had been brought to Omaha by
their professor, Al Auxier – he brings a cl ass every year – to tour Nebraska Furniture Mart and
Borsheim’s, eat at Gorat’s and ha ve a Q&A session with me at Kiewit Plaza. These visitors, like
those who c ome for our a nnual m eeting, l eave i mpressed by both t he ci ty and i ts fri endly
residents. 

Other colleges and universities have now co me calling. Th is school year we will h ave visiting
classes, ranging in size from 30 to 100 students, from Chicago, Dartmouth (Tuck), Delaware State,
Florida State, Indiana, Iowa, Iowa State, Mary land, Nebraska, Northwest Nazarene, Pennsylvania
(Wharton), Stanford, Tennessee, Texas, Te xas A&M, Toronto (Rotman), Union and Utah. M ost
of the students are MBA cand idates, and I’ve been impressed by their quality. Th ey are keenly
interested in business and investments, but their questions indicate that they also have more on
their minds than simply making money. I always feel good after meeting them. 

21
At our sessions, I tell the newcomers the story of the Tennessee group and its spotting of Clayton
Homes. I do th is in th e sp irit o f th e farmer wh o en ters his h en house with an ostrich egg and
admonishes the flo ck: “I do n’t like to complain, girls, but this is j ust a s mall sample of what the
competition is d oing.” To date, our new scouts have not brought us deals. Bu t their mission in
life has been made clear to them. 

• You should be aware of an accounting rule that mildly distorts our financial statements in a pain-
today, gain-tomorrow manner. B erkshire purchases life insurance policies from individuals and
corporations who would otherwise surrender them for cash. As the new holder of the policies, we
pay any premiums that become due and ul timately – wh en the original holder dies – collect the
face value of the policies. 

The original policyholder is u sually in good health when we purchase the p olicy. Still, th e price
we p ay for it is always well ab ove its cash surrend er value (“CSV”). So metimes th e o riginal
policyholder has bo rrowed ag ainst th e C SV to make pr emium paym ents. I n t hat case, t he
remaining CSV will b e tiny and our purchase p rice will be a larg e multiple of what the original
policyholder would have received, had he cashed out by surrendering it. 

Under account ing rules, we must immediately char ge as a realized capi tal loss the excess over
CSV that we pay upon purchasing the policy. We also must make additional charges each year for
the amount by which the premium we pay to keep the policy in force exceeds the increase in CSV. 
But obviously, we don’t think these bookkeeping charges represent economic losses. I f we did,
we wouldn’t buy the policies. 

During 2 004, we rec orded n et “l osses” fr om t he purc hase of policies ( and from t he prem ium
payments required to maintain them) totaling $207 million, which was ch arged against realized
investment gains in our earnings statement (included in “other” i n the table on page 17). When
the proceeds from these policies are receive d in th e future, we will record as realized inve stment
gain the excess over the then-CSV. 

• Two post-bubble governance reforms have been particularly useful at Berkshire, and I fault myself 
for not p utting them in p lace many years a go. Th e first involves regular meetings o f d irectors
without the CEO present. I’ve sat on 19 boards, and on many occasions this process would have
led to dub ious plans being examined more thoroughly. In a few cases, CEO changes that were
needed would also have been made more promptly. There i s no do wnside to this process, an d
there are many possible benefits. 

The second reform concerns the “whistleblower line,” an a rrangement through which employees
can send information to me and the board’s audit committee without fear of reprisal. Berkshire’s
extreme decentralization m akes this system particularly valuable both to me and the committee. 
(In a spra wling “city” of 18 0,000 – B erkshire’s current employee count – n ot every sparrow that
falls will be noticed at headqua rters.) Most of the complaints we have received are of “the guy
next to me has ba d breath” variety, but on occasion I have learned of important problems at our
subsidiaries t hat I ot herwise wo uld have missed. The issues rai sed a re us ually not of a t ype
discoverable by audit, but relate instead to personnel and business practices. B erkshire would be
more valuable today if I had put in a whistleblower line decades ago. 

• Charlie and I love the idea of shareholders thinking and behaving like owners. Sometimes that 
requires them to be pro-active. And in this arena large institutional owners should lead the way. 

So far, however, t he m oves made by i nstitutions h ave been l ess t han a we-inspiring. Us ually,
they’ve focused on m inutiae an d igno red th e th ree questions th at tru ly co unt. First, d oes th e
company have the right CEO? Second, is he/she overreaching in terms of compensation? Third,
are proposed acquisitions more likely to create or destroy per-share value?

22
On such questions, t he i nterests of t he C EO m ay wel l di ffer from thos e o f t he shareholders. 
Directors, moreover, sometimes lack the knowledge or gumption to overrule the CEO. Therefore,
it’s vital that large owners focus on these three questions and speak up when necessary. 

Instead many simply follow a “checklist” approach to the issue du jour. Last year I was on the
receiving end of a judgm ent reached in that manner. Se veral institutional share holders and their
advisors deci ded I lac ked “independence” in my role as a director of Coca-Cola. One group
wanted m e rem oved fr om the b oard a nd anot her si mply want ed m e bo oted from t he au dit
committee. 

My first impulse was to secretly fund the group behind the second idea. Why anyone would wish
to be on an audit committee is beyond me. But since directors must be assigned to one committee
or another, and since no CEO wants me on his compensation committee, it’s often been my lot to
get an audit committee assignment. As it turned out, the institutions that opposed me failed and I
was re-elected to the audit job. (I fought off the urge to ask for a recount.)

Some institutions questioned my “independence” because, among other things, McLane and Dairy
Queen buy lots of Coke products. (Do they want us to favor Pepsi?) But independence is defined
in Webster’s as “not subject to control by others.” I’m puzzled how anyone could conclude that
our C oke p urchases w ould “ control” m y deci sion-making w hen t he co unterweight i s t he wel l-
being of $ 8 billion o f C oke stock hel d by Berkshire. Assuming I ’m even m arginally rat ional,
elementary arithmetic should make it clear that my heart and mind belong to the owners of Coke,
not to its management. 

I can’t resist mentioning that Jesus understood the calibration of independence far more clearly
than do the protesting institutions. In Matthew 6:21 He observed: “For wh ere your treasure is,
there will yo ur h eart b e also .” Ev en to an institutional in vestor, $8 billion sh ould q ualify as
“treasure” that dwarfs any profits Berkshire might earn on its routine transactions with Coke. 

Measured by the biblical standard, the Berkshire board is a model: (a) every director is a member
of a fam ily o wning at l east $ 4 m illion o f st ock; (b) none of t hese s hares were ac quired from
Berkshire via options or grants; (c) no directors receive committee, consulting or board fees from
the company that are more than a tiny portion of their annual income; and (d) although we have a
standard corporate indemnity arrangement, we carry no liability insurance for directors. 

At Berkshire, board members travel the same road as shareholders. 

* * * * * * * * * * * * 

Charlie an d I have see n m uch be havior c onfirming t he Bible’s “t reasure” p oint. I n our vi ew,
based on our considerable boardroom experience, the least independent directors are likely to be
those who receive an im portant fra ction of their annual incom e from the fees they receive for
board service (and who hope as well to be recommended for election to other boards and thereby
to bo ost th eir income fu rther). Yet th ese are the very board m embers most ofte n classed as
“independent.”

Most directors of this type are decent people and do a first-class job. But they wouldn’t be human
if they weren’t tempted to thwart actions that would threaten their livelihood. Some may go on to
succumb to such temptations. 

Let’s look at an example based upon circumstantial evidence. I have first-hand knowledge of a
recent acquisition proposal (not from Berkshire) that was favored by management, blessed by the
company’s i nvestment banke r and sl ated t o go f orward at a price above the lev el at which th e
stock had sold for some years (or now sells for). In addition, a number of directors favored the
transaction and wanted it proposed to shareholders. 

23
Several of t heir brethren, however, each of whom received board and committee fees totaling
about $100,000 annually, scuttled the proposal, which meant that shareholders never learned of
this multi-billion offer. Non-management directors owned little sto ck except for shares they had
received from the company. Their open-market purchases in rece nt y ears had meanwhile been
nominal, even though the stock had sold far below the acquisition price proposed. In other words,
these di rectors di dn’t want t he sha reholders t o be offe red X eve n t hough t hey ha d consi stently
declined the opportunity to buy stock for their own account at a fraction of X. 

I do n’t kn ow which di rectors op posed l etting s hareholders see t he offe r. B ut I do k now t hat
$100,000 is an important portion of the annual income of som e of t hose deemed “independent,”
clearly meeting the Matthew 6:21 definition of “treasure.” If the deal had gone through, these fees
would have ended. 

Neither th e shareholders nor I will ev er kn ow what motivated th e d issenters. Indeed t hey
themselves will n ot li kely kno w, given t hat sel f-interest i nevitably blurs in trospection. We do
know one thing, though: At the same meeting at which the deal was rejected, the board voted itself
a significant increase in directors’ fees. 

• While we are on th e sub ject o f self-i nterest, let’s tu rn again to the m ost i mportant acco unting 
mechanism sti ll av ailable to CEOs who wish to overstate earni ngs: t he non-expensing of st ock
options. T he accomplices in perpetuating t his absurdity have been many members of Congress
who have defied the arguments put forth by all Big Four auditors, all members of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board and virtually all investment professionals. 

I’m enclosing an op-ed piece I wrote for The Washington Post describing a truly breathtaking bill
that was passed 312-111 by the House last summer. Thanks to Senator Richard Shelby, the Senate
didn’t ratify th e Ho use’s foo lishness. And , to h is great cred it, Bill Do naldson, th e in vestor-
minded Chairman of the SEC, has stood firm against massive political pressure, generated by the
check-waving CEOs who first muscled Congress in 1993 about the issue of option accounting and
then repeated the tactic last year. 

Because the attempts to obfuscate the stock-option issue continue, it’s worth pointing out that no
one – neither the FASB, nor investors generally, nor I – are t alking about restricting the use o f
options in a ny way. Indeed, my successor at Berkshire may well receive m uch of his pay via
options, albeit logically-structured ones in respect to 1) an appropriate strike price, 2) an escalation
in price that reflects the retention of earnings, and 3) a ban on his quickly disposing of any shares
purchased t hrough o ptions. We chee r arra ngements t hat motivate managers, w hether t hese be
cash bonuses or options. And if a co mpany is tru ly receiving value for the options it issues, we
see no reason why recording their cost should cut down on their use. 

The simple fact is th at certain CEOs know their own compensation would be far more rationally
determined if options were expensed. They also suspect that their stock would sell at a lower price
if realistic accounting were employed, meaning that they would reap less in the market when they
unloaded their personal holdings. To these CEOs such unpleasant prospects are a fate to be fought
with all th e resources they have at hand – even though the funds they use in t hat fight normally
don’t belong to them, but are instead put up by their shareholders. 

Option-expensing i s sc heduled t o become mandatory o n J une 15th. You ca n the refore expect
intensified efforts to stall o r emasculate this rule between now and then. Let yo ur Congressman
and Senators know what you think on this issue.

[SECTION: The Annual Meeting]

There are two cha nges this year concerning t he an nual meeting. Fi rst, we ha ve sc heduled t he
meeting for the last Satu rday in Ap ril (the 3 0th), rath er th an the u sual first Saturd ay in May. Th is year
Mother’s Day falls on May 8, and it would be unfair to ask the employees of Borsheim’s and Gorat’s to
take care of us at that special time – so we’ve m oved everything up a week. Next year we’ll return to our
regular timing, holding the meeting on May 6, 2006. 

Additionally, we are c hanging the sequence of e vents on meeting day, April 30. J ust as al ways,
the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m. and the movie will be shown at 8:30. At 9:30, however,
we will go directly to the question and answer period, which (allowing for lunch at the Qwest’s stands) will
last until 3:00. Then, after a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:15. 

We have made this change because a number of shareholders complained last year about the time
consumed by two speakers who advocated proposals of limited interest to the majority of t he audience –
and who were no doubt relishing their chance to talk to a captive group of about 19,500. With our n ew
procedure, those shareholders who wish to hear it all can stick around for the formal meeting and those who
don’t can leave – or better yet shop. 

There w ill b e plenty of opportunity fo r th at p astime in th e v ast ex hibition h all th at adj oins th e
meeting area. Kelly Muchemore, the Fl o Zi egfeld of B erkshire, put o n a magnificent sh opping
extravaganza last year, and she says that was just a warm-up for this year. (Kelly, I am delighted to report,
is getting married in October. I’m giving her away and suggested that she make a little history by holding
the wedding at the annual meeting. She balked, however, when Charlie insisted that he be the ringbearer.)

Again we will showcase a 2,1 00 square foot Cl ayton home (featuring Acme brick, Shaw carpet,
Johns Manville insulation, MiTek fasteners, Carefree awnings and NFM furniture). Take a t our through
the home. Better yet, buy it. 

GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of
them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In m ost cases, GEICO will b e able to give you a
special shareholder discount (us ually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 45 of t he 50 jurisdictions in
which we o perate. B ring the details of y our existing insurance and check out whether we can sa ve you
money. 

On Saturd ay, at the Omaha airport, we will have t he u sual array of aircraft from NetJets®
available for your inspection. Stop by the NetJets booth at the Qwest t o learn about viewing these planes. 
Come to Omaha by bus; leave in your new plane. 

The Bookworm shop did a terrific business last year selling Berkshire-related books. Di splaying
18 titles, they sold 2,920 copies for $61,000. Since we charge the shop no rent (I must be getting soft), it 
gives shareholders a 20% discount. This year I’ve asked The Bookworm to add Graham Allison’s Nuclear
Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe, a must-read for those concerned with the safety of our
country. In addition, the shop will premiere Poor Charlie’s Almanack, a book compiled by Peter Kaufman. 
Scholars have for too long debated whether Charlie is the reincarnation of Ben Franklin. This book should
settle the question. 

An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain
the credential you will n eed for ad mission to the meeting and other events. As fo r plane, hotel and car
reservations, we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. They do
a terrific job for us each year, and I thank them for it. 

At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72nd Street between Dodge and Pacific,
we will again be having “Berkshire Weekend” pricing. We initiated this special event at NFM eight years
ago, and sales during the “Weekend” grew from $5.3 million in 1997 to $25.1 million in 2004 (up 45%
25
from a year earlier). Every year has set a new record, and on Saturday of l ast year, we had the largest
single-day sales in NFM’s history – $6.1 million. 

To get t he discount, y ou m ust make y our purchases between Th ursday, A pril 2 8 a nd M onday,
May 2 inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period’s special pricing will even apply to
the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against discounting but
that, i n t he s pirit of our s hareholder weekend, have m ade a n exce ption for y ou. We a ppreciate their
cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m . Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 6 p. m. on
Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we are having a special affair for s hareholders
only. I’ll be there, eating barbeque and drinking Coke. 

Borsheim’s – the largest jewelry store in the country except for Tiffany’s Manhattan store – will
have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Friday,
April 29. Th e second, the main gala, will b e from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday, May 1 . On Saturday, we
will be open until 6 p.m. 

We w ill h ave h uge crow ds at Bo rsheim’s th roughout th e w eekend. Fo r your con venience,
therefore, shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25 through Saturday, May 7 . During
that pe riod, j ust i dentify y ourself as a s hareholder t hrough y our m eeting c redentials o r a b rokerage
statement. 

Borsheim’s o perates on a gross m argin th at is fu lly twenty p ercentage points below t hat of its
major rivals, even before the shareholders’ discount. Last year, business over the weekend increased 73%
from 2003, setting a record that will be tough to beat. Show me it can be done. 

In a tent outside of Borsheim’s, Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion, will take on all comers
in groups of six – blindfolded. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon Osberg, two of th e
world’s top bridge experts, available to play with our shareholders on Sunday afternoon. They plan to keep
their eyes open – but Bob never sorts his cards, even when playing for a national championship. 

Gorat’s – my fav orite steakhouse – will again be open exclusively for Berk shire shareholders on
Sunday, May 1, and will be serving from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m. Please remember that to come to Gorat’s on
that day, you must have a reservation. To make one, call 40 2-551-3733 on April 1 ( but not before). If
Sunday is sold out, try Gorat’s on one of the other evenings you will be in town. Enhance your reputation
as an epicure by ordering, as I do, a rare T-bone with a double helping of hash browns. 

We will again have a special r eception from 4:00 to 5: 30 on Saturday afternoon for shareholders
who have come from outside of North America. Every year our meeting draws many people from around
the globe, and Charlie and I want to be sure we personally greet those who have come so far. Last year we
enjoyed meeting more than 400 of you including at least 100 from Australia. Any shareholder who comes
from other than the U.S. or Canada will be g iven a special credential and instructions for atten ding this
function.

Charlie and I are lucky. We have jobs that we love and are helped every day in a myriad of ways
by talented and cheerful associates. No wonder we tap-dance to work. But nothing is more fun for us than
getting together with our shareholder-partners at Berkshire’s annual meeting. So join us on April 30th at the
Qwest for our annual Woodstock for Capitalists.
